JSON Form Design in Enterprise React Applications
-> Using JSON for Dynamic form generation, flexible validation and standardization.

Page 2:
Why JSON Based Forms ?
-> Decouples UI from Business logic.
-> Enables rapid development and updates.
-> Enhances consistency and reusability.

Page 3:
Dynamic Form Generation
-->Forms are generated based on JSON schema
-->Supports multiple input types and complex layouts
-->Benefits:
1) Reduces redundant code
2) Increases maintainability
3) Enables real-time form modifications

Page 4:
Flexible Validation Rules
-->Validation rules defined in JSON schema
-->Supports:
1) Required fields
2) Regex-based validation
3) Conditional validation
4) Role-based validation
-->Benefits:
1) Centralized control over validation
2) Enhances adaptability

Page 5:
Standardization of Validation Framework
-->Ensures uniform validation across applications
-->Reduces code duplication
-->Easily extendable for new validation rules
-->Integration with existing enterprise validation systems

Page 6:
Configuration-Driven Approach
-->JSON configuration defines form fields, validation, and rules
-->Changes can be made without modifying core code
-->Enables dynamic business logic updates

Page 7:
Pros and Cons of JSON-Based Forms
Pros
1) Scalable and reusable
2) Easy modifications without code changes
3) Consistent validation framework
Cons
1) Initial setup complexity
2) Potential performance issues with deeply nested JSON
3) Debugging can be challenging
